# Website

This is my personal website where I showcase my projects and skills.

This website not only shows what I have learned but also the road I took to get to where I am today. The `Projects` section is in a reverse chronological order so by following the trail, you can see my advancements and progress. I also tried to reflect on the problems I encountered and how I solved them in `Exploration` section of each project. Hopefully, this website will give insight as to what kind of a developer I am and maybe inspire/guide new developers.

## Significance
While creating this site, I wanted to use as many skills and tricks as I could that I learned along the way. This helped me remember solutions to problems I faced previously and will hopefully ensure that I face less of them in the future. Combining my past and new knowledge allowed me to understand these solutions in a deeper level.

I chose to use NextJS in addition to React. I did not make full use of routing and server-side-rendering in this website because it is basically static and single page. But gaining experience in a simpler website allowed me to learn the features of NextJS without having to solve other, distracting, problems. 

## I Used
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to have routing and server-side-rendering on top of React
* [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) to have a more streamlined development experience
* [Framer Motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) to create easy and dynamic animations
* [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) to make JavaScript type enforced
* [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) to have cleaner CSS files
